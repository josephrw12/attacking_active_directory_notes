# Domain Enumeration
1. Let's start with Domain Enumeration and map various entities, trusts, relationships and privileges for the target domain.
2. The enumeration can be done by using Native executables and .NET classes: 

The command below is an example of a .NET class, but as you can see it's rather complicated to use

```PowerShell
$ADClass = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain] $ADClass::GetCurrentDomain()
```

So we will covering PowerView, and the Microsoft Signed Active Director Module, to complete all tasks

<p>Either of the modules mentioned, can be used.</p>

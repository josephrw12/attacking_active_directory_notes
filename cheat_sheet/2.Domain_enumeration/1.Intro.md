# Domain Enumeration
1. Let's start with Domain Enumeration and map various entities, trusts, relationships and privileges for the target domain.
2. The enumeration can be done by using Native executables and .NET classes: 

```PowerShell
$ADClass = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain] $ADClass::GetCurrentDomain()
```
